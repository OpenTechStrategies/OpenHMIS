OpenHMIS API
============

The OpenHMIS API is a web-based API for collecting data and generating
reports about sources and users of social services.  Its underlying
data schema is based on the [2014 HUD HMIS Data
Standards](http://www.hudhdx.info/VendorResources.aspx) (see
especially the [Logical Model UML
diagram](http://www.hudhdx.info/Resources/Vendors/4_0/HMIS_Logical_Model.pdf))
from the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development](http://hud.gov/).

The latest OpenHMIS API documentation is currently in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-7OoU0fRtdq9IUuATA9AQfZsuDnkq03X9ORbs94udE/edit?pli=1).

(Historical background: ["API Methods for 3^rd Party Developers"](https://code.google.com/p/openciss/wiki/openCISS_API_v2) describes an earlier version of the API, but needs updating to conform to 2014 data standards and use cases.)
